                to submit to a visa interview by the country you intend to
                visit. Most visa applications are approved or denied without the
                need for an interview, but the visa officer may request one. The
                following are common questions you may be asked during a visa
                interview:
                <ul>
                  <li>Why do you want to travel to X country?</li>
                  <li>Why do you want to visit at this specific time?</li>
                  <li>Do you have a criminal record?</li>
                  <li>Are you travelling with someone else?</li>
                  <li>Who will you be visiting?</li>
                  <li>How long will you stay?</li>
                  <li>Where will you stay?</li>
                  <li>Have you booked airline tickets?</li>
                  <li>Do you have health insurance for this trip?</li>
                  <li>
                    If you are currently employed, do you have proper leave from
                    your workplace for the duration of the trip?
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Will you return to your home country after your visit?

                Make sure to check the government website of the country you
                intend to visit to find out how fast they process visa
                applications. For example, visa applications from Russia to
                visit Canada take approximately 8 days to process, while
                Canadians looking to travel to India are advised to submit visa
                applications at least 15 days in advance.

                sure to check with your destination country’s appropriate
                government website to find out. Requirements typically include
                filling out the visa application form, providing your passport
                for stamping if required, a photograph, and additional documents
                such as your flight itinerary, hotel booking or letter of
                invitation.<br />
                Many countries also have inadmissibility guidelines when it
                comes to issuing visas. Potential visitors may be deemed
                inadmissible if, for example, they have a criminal history, are
                a security risk, have a serious health problem, have serious
                financial problems and more.<br />

                If you do not meet the visa requirements for the country you
                intend to visit it is highly likely that your visa application
                will be denied and you will not be allowed entry into the
                country.

                letter from the person you intend to visit stating that they are
                inviting you to visit them in that country. Invitation letters
                help travel authorities vet potential visitors by making sure
                that a temporary visit is indeed the true nature of the visa
                request. Check with your intended destination’s government
                website for details on what needs to be included in a such a

              <small
                >A country’s visa policy is a rule that states who may or may
                not enter the country. The policy may allow passport holders of
                one country to enter visa-free but not the passport holders of
                another country. Most visa policies are bilateral, meaning that
                two countries will allow visa-free travel to each other’s
                citizens, but this is not always the case. For example, Canadian
                passport holders may travel to Grenada visa-free, but Grenadians
                must apply for a visa in order to travel to Canada.<br />
                There are no hard and fast rules for countries when determining
                visa policies. However, some typical considerations include
                diplomatic relations with the other country, the history, if
                any, of illegal immigration from the country, cost and tourism
                factors, and more.

                the flow of visitors in and out of the country and to prevent
                illegal immigration and other criminal activities. Forcing
                travellers to apply for a visa allows the authorities to vet
                potential visitors. For example, individuals may attempt to
                travel to a country with better economic opportunities in order
                to work illegally there.

                does not have a visa policy in place with your home country.<br />
                Many countries have visa policies and agreements that allow
                their citizens to travel freely between them without the need
                for a visa. For example, Canadians and Americans do not need
                visas in order to travel to each other’s countries, only valid
                travel documents. However, Canadians do need visas to travel to
                Bhutan, for example, since no visa agreement exists between the
                two nations.
