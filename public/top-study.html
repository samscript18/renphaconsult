              <p>
                Rising two places this year is Spain, a country known for its
                vibrant and welcoming culture. Spain has a long and storied
                history of conquest, diversity, and heritage reflected in its
                art, cuisine, music, languages, literature, and traditions. Even
                a quick glance at the menu of a tapas bar will give you a
                glimpse of the eclectic experiences Spain has to offer. The
                country is a haven for students of art, architecture, and
                design, with the works of masters like Goya, Gaudi, Calatrava,
                Dali, Campo Baeza, and Picasso providing inspiration. Spain is
                also rising as a tech and innovation center – the country
                launched its Spanish Smart Cities Network in 2011, and Barcelona
                was named the European Capital of Innovation in 2014. With each
                region and city offering unique cultural experiences, the most
                challenging decision about studying in Spain might be which city
                to choose – and what to study once you get there. ¡Vamos!

                For many people, the glamour and charm of Paris sums up the
                appeal of France, and while Paris is certainly the country’s
                crown jewel, studying in France is so much more than just a
                stroll down the Seine. With more than 3,500 public and private
                higher education institutions – from universities and Grandes
                Ecoles to specialized schools for everything from art to
                medicine – your opportunities for excellent higher education are
                nearly limitless in France. Couple that with France’s cultural
                clout, and you have the ideal study location for someone looking
                for a top-ranked degree and an international experience to last
                a lifetime. Whether you settle in Paris or Provence, studying in
                France will offer you a wealth of opportunities to explore.

                The UK is never far from the top of our list, and for good

                throughout the world. For medical and STEM students, Canada
                offers extensive research opportunities, and international
                students in all fields will find generous funding options and
                work schemes. Canada is also a great option for language
                students. With French and English as official languages,
                studying in Canada is an excellent way to learn a new language.
                The country is diverse in more than just language. Stretching
                more than 5,500 kilometers across the top of North America,
                Canada is the second largest country by area in the world and
                features a diversity of climates, landscapes, and cultures. From
                the maritime and mild east and west coasts to the arctic tundra
                and mountainous majesty of the northwest, Canada presents
                awesome natural beauty.
